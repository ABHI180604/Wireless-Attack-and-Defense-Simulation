# Wireless Attack & Defense Simulation

This project simulates a wireless network attack and demonstrates a passive defense mechanism to detect and respond to suspicious activity. The simulation involves scanning for nearby Wi-Fi networks, launching a spoofed packet attack against a target device, and using a defender script to identify and alert on the malicious traffic.

***

## 📜 Project Overview

The simulation operates in two main parts:

1.  **Attacker (`attacker_simulation.py`)**: This script scans for wireless networks, allows the user to select a target, and sends spoofed packets to a specified victim's MAC address. This simulates an attacker attempting to probe or eavesdrop on the target device.
2.  [cite_start]**Defender (`passive_defender.py`)**: This script monitors network traffic on a specific interface. [cite_start]It identifies packets targeting the host machine and checks the source MAC address against a list of trusted devices. [cite_start]If an unknown MAC address sends packets to the host, it triggers an alert and disconnects the Wi-Fi to mitigate the potential threat.

[cite_start]A `packet_classifier.py` utility is also included to help categorize different types of network packets[cite: 2].

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Attacker Simulation

The **`attacker_simulation.py`** script performs the following steps:
1.  **Enable Monitor Mode**: Puts a selected wireless interface into monitor mode to capture all nearby Wi-Fi traffic.
2.  **Scan Networks**: Uses `airodump-ng` to scan for Wi-Fi networks and saves the results to a CSV file.
3.  **Parse Networks**: Reads the CSV file to display a list of available networks (BSSIDs and ESSIDs).
4.  **Simulate Attack**: After the user selects a network and provides a victim's MAC address, the script sends a series of spoofed DNS query packets to the victim using Scapy.

### Passive Defender

The **`passive_defender.py`** script is the countermeasure:
1.  **Packet Sniffing**: Monitors network traffic on a specified interface using Scapy.
2.  **MAC Address Validation**: It checks the source MAC address of incoming packets against a list of known MACs.
3.  **Alerting**: If a packet is addressed to the host machine from an unrecognized MAC address, it triggers an alert.
4.  **Logging**: All captured traffic and security alerts are logged to a file in the `logs/` directory.
5.  **Mitigation**: As a defensive measure, it automatically disconnects the machine from the Wi-Fi network to prevent further unauthorized communication.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A Linux environment (Kali Linux is recommended for its pre-installed tools).
* Python 3.
* A wireless network adapter that supports monitor mode.
* The `Aircrack-ng` suite (`airodump-ng`).
* Scapy and other Python libraries, which can be installed via pip:
    ```bash
    pip install scapy
    ```

### Running the Simulation

**1. Configure the Defender**

Open `src/passive_defender.py` and modify the following variables:
* `OWN_MAC`: Set this to the MAC address of the machine you want to defend.
* `KNOWN_MACS`: Add the MAC addresses of trusted devices on your network (e.g., your router, other personal devices).

**2. Run the Defender**

Open a terminal and start the defender script. You will be prompted to enter the network interface to monitor (e.g., `wlan0` or `Wi-Fi`).

```bash
cd src
python3 passive_defender.py
